To build efficient software-as-a-service applications, use declarative formats for setup automation. This approach minimizes the time and cost associated with onboarding new developers, streamlining the integration process and making it easier for team members to collaborate on the project.
Ensure your application has a clean contract with the underlying operating system to maximize portability between execution environments. By adhering to this principle, you will be able to deploy your application in various contexts without encountering compatibility issues.
Design your application to be suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, eliminating the need for servers and systems administration. Embracing this principle allows you to take advantage of the flexibility, scalability, and cost savings provided by cloud-based infrastructure.
Strive to minimize the divergence between development and production environments to enable continuous deployment and achieve maximum agility. By maintaining consistency across environments, you will be able to rapidly identify and address issues, accelerating the development process.
Ensure your application can scale up without significant changes to its tooling, architecture, or development practices. This approach will allow you to accommodate growing user bases and increased demand without the need for major overhauls or resource-intensive modifications.
Remember that the twelve-factor methodology is versatile and can be applied to applications written in any programming language, using any combination of backing services such as databases, queues, or memory caches. By adhering to these principles, you will be able to create robust, scalable, and maintainable software-as-a-service applications.

Ensure your application is always tracked in a version control system, such as Git, Mercurial, or Subversion. This allows you to maintain a code repository, or repo, which serves as the foundation for your application's codebase. Your codebase should be singular and unique to your application, as having multiple codebases indicates a distributed system rather than a single app.
Your single codebase should be capable of deploying multiple instances of your application. These deployments might include production sites, staging sites, and local development environments for each developer on your team. While the codebase remains consistent across all deployments, different versions may be active in each environment. For instance, a developer may have commits that haven't yet been deployed to staging, or staging may have commits that haven't been deployed to production. Despite these differences, all deployments share the same codebase, making them identifiable as unique instances of the same application.
Avoid sharing code across multiple applications, as this is a violation of the twelve-factor principles. Instead, factor out shared code into libraries and include them through a dependency manager. This practice ensures that each application maintains its own distinct codebase, while still benefiting from the shared code in a modular and maintainable way. This approach enables you to build scalable and resilient applications that adhere to the twelve-factor recommendations.

Declare and isolate your application's dependencies explicitly to ensure smooth functioning across various systems. Utilize your programming language's packaging system to distribute support libraries and avoid relying on system-wide packages. Specify all dependencies in a dependency declaration manifest and use a dependency isolation tool during execution to prevent unexpected dependencies from the system; this approach should be applied consistently across both production and development environments.
Emphasizing explicit dependency declaration makes it easier for new developers to set up the application on their machines. With only the language runtime and dependency manager as prerequisites, they can use a deterministic build command to configure everything needed to run the application. This streamlined process reduces setup time and potential errors.
Ensure that your application does not depend on any system tools, such as ImageMagick or curl. While these tools may be present on numerous systems, there is no guarantee that they will be available or compatible with your app on all potential systems. If your application requires a specific system tool, it is best to vendor that tool into the app to maintain control over its availability and compatibility.

Store your application's configuration in environment variables to ensure a strict separation of config from code. Environment variables are easy to modify between deploys without making changes to your codebase. They are also language- and OS-agnostic, making them a versatile choice for managing configuration across different platforms.
Avoid storing configuration in constants within your code. Configuration values often differ between deploys, while code typically remains consistent. By separating configuration from code, you can open-source your codebase at any time without compromising sensitive credentials.
Be cautious with config files that are not checked into version control. While they are an improvement over using constants in the code, they still have drawbacks. It is possible to accidentally check them into your code repository or scatter them in various places and formats, which can make managing configuration more challenging.
When managing your application's configuration, opt for granularity rather than grouping. Grouping configurations into named sets, such as environments, can lead to scaling problems as your application grows and more deploys are needed. Instead, use environment variables as granular controls that are independently managed for each deploy, ensuring a scalable model as your application expands over time.

Treat all backing services as attached resources, regardless of whether they are local or third-party services. This ensures that your application can easily switch between different services without making changes to the code. Instead, you only need to update the resource handle in the configuration. This approach promotes flexibility and enables you to replace malfunctioning services or scale your application by attaching or detaching resources as needed.
Your application should not differentiate between locally-managed and third-party services. Both types should be treated as attached resources that can be accessed through a URL or other locator/credentials found in the configuration. This approach allows you to swap out services, such as databases or SMTP servers, with minimal effort, making your application more adaptable and resilient.
Each unique backing service is considered a distinct resource, and your application should treat them as loosely coupled components. This loose coupling allows for easy management and modification of your application's resources without altering the code. It also enables you to scale your application more efficiently by adding or removing resources as required.
The ability to attach and detach resources from your application without changing the code is a key advantage of treating backing services as attached resources. In case of issues with a resource, such as hardware problems in a database, you can quickly set up a new resource and replace the problematic one. This ensures minimal disruption to your application and enhances its overall reliability.

Separate the stages of building, releasing, and running your application to promote a more streamlined and efficient deployment process. In the build stage, transform your code repository into an executable bundle by fetching dependencies and compiling binaries and assets. This stage should be initiated by developers when new code is deployed.
The release stage combines the build with the current configuration to create a release that is ready for immediate execution. Each release should have a unique ID, and the release history should be append-only, meaning once a release is created, it cannot be altered. Instead, any changes should result in a new release. Utilize deployment tools with release management features, such as the ability to roll back to a previous release.
Lastly, the run stage launches your application in the execution environment. Minimize the complexity of this stage to avoid problems that could occur during runtime, such as server reboots or crashed processes. By keeping the run stage as simple as possible, you reduce the likelihood of issues arising when developers are not available to address them.

Execute your application as stateless processes in the execution environment. Stateless processes ensure that any data that needs to persist is stored in a stateful backing service, such as a database. Avoid relying on the memory space or filesystem of the process for more than a brief, single-transaction cache. Never assume that cached data will be available in future requests or jobs, as different processes may handle them or a restart may wipe out local state.
Keep your processes share-nothing and avoid using "sticky sessions" where user session data is cached in the memory of the application's process. Relying on sticky sessions is a violation of the twelve-factor app principles. Instead, consider using a datastore with time-expiration capabilities, like Memcached or Redis, for storing session state data.
For asset management, prefer to compile and package assets during the build stage. This approach helps maintain the stateless nature of your application processes. Tools like Jammit and the Rails asset pipeline can be configured to package assets during the build stage, which is in line with the twelve-factor app recommendations.
Remember that twelve-factor processes can range from simple standalone scripts to sophisticated applications with multiple process types. Regardless of the complexity, adhere to the principles of statelessness and share-nothing to ensure scalability and maintainability of your application.

Ensure your applications are self-contained and independent of their execution environment. To achieve this, export services via port binding. By binding to a port and listening for incoming requests, your application can efficiently handle HTTP requests. This approach allows for greater flexibility and compatibility with various programming languages and frameworks. Utilize a webserver library specific to your language or framework to implement this functionality in your application's code.
In local development, access your application's services through a URL like http://localhost:5000/. When deploying, a routing layer manages requests from public-facing hostnames to the web processes associated with the appropriate port. This setup ensures a seamless transition from development to production environments, enabling scalability and maintainability.
Port binding is not limited to HTTP services; it can be applied to any server software that listens for incoming requests on a specific port. Examples include XMPP servers like ejabberd or Redis servers speaking the Redis protocol. This versatility allows your application to serve as a backing service for another application by providing its URL as a resource handle in the consuming application's configuration.

Adopt the process model to scale your application effectively. By treating processes as first-class citizens, you can design your app to manage various workloads by assigning each workload to a specific process type. For instance, assign HTTP requests to a web process and long-running background tasks to a worker process. This approach allows your application to scale horizontally, as you can add more concurrency effortlessly and reliably.
In a twelve-factor app, leverage the Unix process model for running service daemons. While it is acceptable for individual processes to handle their internal multiplexing using threads or async/evented models, remember that a single virtual machine has limitations. Your application should be capable of spanning multiple processes running on different physical machines to accommodate growth.
Scaling out becomes more straightforward with the process model. The share-nothing, horizontally partitionable nature of twelve-factor app processes enables easy and reliable addition of more concurrency. The combination of process types and the number of processes for each type forms the process formation.
Avoid daemonizing processes or writing PID files in a twelve-factor app. Instead, rely on the operating system's process manager or a distributed process manager on a cloud platform to manage output streams, handle crashed processes, and manage user-initiated restarts and shutdowns. This approach ensures a more robust and resilient application infrastructure.

Maximize your application's robustness by ensuring fast startup and graceful shutdown of processes. Disposable processes that can be started or stopped quickly support elastic scaling, rapid code or configuration changes deployment, and improved production stability. Minimizing startup time, ideally to just a few seconds, enhances the release process and scaling up, and facilitates moving processes to new machines as needed.
Graceful shutdown of processes is achieved when they receive a SIGTERM signal from the process manager. For web processes, stop listening on the service port to refuse new requests, allow ongoing requests to complete, and then exit. Ensure that HTTP requests are short or that clients can reconnect seamlessly if a long polling connection is lost.
Worker processes should return the current job to the work queue upon graceful shutdown. This can be done using various methods, such as sending a NACK with RabbitMQ or relying on Beanstalkd's automatic job return when a worker disconnects. If using lock-based systems, release the lock on the job record. Design jobs to be reentrant by wrapping results in a transaction or making operations idempotent.
Build processes to withstand sudden death due to underlying hardware failure, even though it is less common than graceful shutdowns. Using a robust queueing backend, such as Beanstalkd, that returns jobs to the queue if clients disconnect or time out is one approach. Overall, architect your application to handle unexpected, non-graceful terminations and consider implementing crash-only design principles for optimal robustness.

Ensure that your development, staging, and production environments are as similar as possible in order to facilitate continuous deployment. By reducing the time gap between writing code and deploying it, you can streamline your workflow and enable rapid iterations. Encourage developers who write code to be actively involved in the deployment process, monitoring its behavior in production. This close involvement helps to minimize personnel gaps and promotes better understanding of the entire application lifecycle.
Make sure you maintain consistency between the tools and backing services used in both development and production environments. This is crucial for avoiding small incompatibilities that can cause code to fail in production, even if it worked well during development or staging. Such inconsistencies can create friction that discourages continuous deployment, negatively impacting the overall efficiency of your application development process.
Resist the urge to use different backing services for development and production, even if adapters claim to abstract away any differences. Instead, aim for dev/prod parity by using the same type and version of each backing service across all environments. Modern packaging systems make it easy to install and run backing services like Memcached, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ, while declarative provisioning tools combined with lightweight virtual environments can help you create local environments that closely resemble production setups. 
The benefits of dev/prod parity and continuous deployment far outweigh the costs of installing and using these systems.
While adapters for various backing services can be useful for porting to new services, it's important to maintain consistency across all deployments of your app, including developer environments, staging, and production. Ensuring that you use the same type and version of each backing service will help you avoid potential issues and promote a smoother deployment process.

Treat your application logs as a continuous stream of events that provide insight into your application's behavior. Logs are composed of aggregated, time-ordered events collected from running processes and backing services. They are typically in text format with one event per line. Don't focus on managing or routing log output, as this is not the responsibility of the application.
To ensure proper log handling, write the event stream from each running process unbuffered to stdout. This will allow you to observe the application's behavior during local development in the terminal. In staging or production environments, the execution environment captures and collates each process' stream, routing it to appropriate destinations for viewing and archiving.
Leverage open-source log routers like Logplex and Fluentd to manage the routing and storage of log event streams. These routers ensure that logs are sent to appropriate destinations such as log indexing systems, data warehousing systems, or even real-time terminal views. This separation of concerns keeps your application code clean and focused on its core functionality.
Make use of log analysis systems like Splunk or Hadoop/Hive to gain insights into your application's behavior over time. These systems allow you to search for specific past events, generate graphs for trend analysis, and set up alerts based on custom-defined criteria. By treating logs as event streams and utilizing proper log management tools, you'll be able to monitor, diagnose, and optimize your application effectively.

Execute administrative and management tasks as single-use processes in the same environment as your regular app processes. This ensures consistency and prevents potential synchronization issues. Common examples include database migrations, running a console for arbitrary code execution, or executing one-time scripts. By using identical environments, you can ensure that the codebase and configurations are the same across all process types.
Isolate dependencies for each process type to maintain consistency across your application. For instance, if a specific command is used to start your web process, the same technique should be employed for running database migrations or other tasks. Adhering to these practices can prevent unintended side effects caused by discrepancies in dependency management.
Choose programming languages that provide a built-in REPL shell and simplify the execution of one-off scripts. This allows developers to easily run administrative tasks in the app's local environment. In a production setting, use remote command execution mechanisms, such as SSH, to carry out these tasks. By leveraging languages with robust tooling, you can streamline the execution of administrative tasks and maintain the integrity of your application.
